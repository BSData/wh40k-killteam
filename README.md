__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]
